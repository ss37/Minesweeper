I used to play this game in the classic Windows desktops of the 90s. I tried to replicate it in its most basic form using only JavaScript, HTML5, SVG and Bootstrap. It started out as one of my assignments for my Web Technologies and Standards course in Fall 2014, where I had generated mines statically.

In the second version of this game, I added a few lines to in the JavaScript, to randomly generate mines, and ensure its neighboring cells displayed the correct number when uncovered by the player.
